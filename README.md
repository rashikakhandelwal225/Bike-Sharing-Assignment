# Bike-Sharing-Assignment
Consider a bike sharing system that has a dataset.You are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features.

The company wants to know:

- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- How well those variables describe the bike demands
So interpretation is important!

The steps we will follow in this exercise are as follows-

Data Reading ,Understanding, Cleaning and Visualization
Preparing the data for modelling(train-test split, rescaling etc.)
Training the model
Residual Analysis
Predictions and Evaluations on the test set
